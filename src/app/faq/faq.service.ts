We are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make diversity training more interactive, while collecting data and focusing on the userâ€™s concerns. To do this, we are creating a chatbot using natural language processing algorithms. This interactivity will increase the interest and attention of users, as well as provide data to improve the training content. On top of improving training content, the chatbot will learn to answer any questions a user might ask. At the end of the training, the employees will take a feedback quiz based on what they learned, providing the program information about what was truly helpful and what could be improved. Our program will additionally be inclusive to employees with visual disabilities, by using text to speech software, allowing them to engage in the same way as their visually abled coworkers.'),
